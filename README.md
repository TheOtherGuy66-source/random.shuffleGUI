# Media Player

This is my custom media player I created just for fun. The auto-play directory is hardcoded due to permission issues when trying to seek any drive on the computer with a folder named "Music." Hardcoding was the easier and simplest way.

This script can do a lot of stuff:
- Randomly play music
- Play music in order from a picked directory or the playlist (the playlist non-random feature is kind of buggy; it may or may not work, but the non-random feature from selecting the directory works fine)
- Play videos (requires ffmpeg installed)

You can fork this and do whatever you want with it. I don't care; it was just a project I started to see if I could make something, and it turned into something a little bit bigger than I could imagine creating. I couldn't really think of anything else to add to it.

The script obviously requires Python installed. Like with all my scripts, the modules for the pips should automatically install. I never included a feature to upgrade your pip manager, though, but it'll tell you if it's outdated.

## Directory Management

```python
async def auto_load_dir():
    global current_dir, song_files, song_count, skip_count, start_time
    current_dir = 'D:\\Music'
    await load_songs_from_directory(current_dir)
```

# Installing Python 3.12.5 from Source

Follow these steps to install Python 3.12.5 from source on a Linux system.

## 1. Update Your Package List

First, make sure your package list is up to date by running:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## 2. Install Prerequisites

You'll need some development tools and libraries required for building Python from source:

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev tk-dev libffi-dev wget
```

## 3. Download the Python Source

Download the Python 3.12.5 source tarball:

```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.5/Python-3.12.5.tgz
```

## 4. Extract the Downloaded Archive

Extract the tarball:

```
tar -xf Python-3.12.5.tgz
```

## 5. Build and Install Python

Change into the Python source directory, then configure the build environment, compile, and install:

```
cd Python-3.12.5
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make altinstall
```

The `--enable-optimizations` flag optimizes the Python binary by running multiple tests. The `make altinstall` command is used instead of `make install` to avoid overwriting the default Python version installed by the system.

## 6. Verify the Installation

Verify that Python 3.12.5 was installed successfully:

```
python3.12 --version
```

## Directory Management

```python
async def auto_load_dir():
    global current_dir, song_files, song_count, skip_count, start_time
    current_dir = '/mnt/HDD/Music'  # Linux directory adjustment
    await load_songs_from_directory(current_dir)
```
